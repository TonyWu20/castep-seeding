/// This keyword provides an estimate of the average phonon frequency at the gamma
/// point. It is used to initialize the Hessian for BFGS geometry optimization with
/// ionic relaxation. One expects to achieve faster convergence of the geometry
/// optimization if the value is realistic. The idea is that this single number
/// represents the whole of the Hessian in a compact form.
/// The value of the estimated frequency is provided in the CASTEP output after
/// the geometry optimization run, and this value can be used as an input parameter
/// for a new calculation on a similar system. An example would be a study of
/// different configurations of a self-interstitial defect in silicon.
/// # Note
/// The value of the estimated frequency as returned by CASTEP should not be
/// interpreted as an actual frequency of any real vibrational mode.
/// # Default
/// 50 THz
/// # Example
/// `GEOM_FREQUENCY_EST : 17.54 THz`
